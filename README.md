# FrenchVerbConjugator

The objective of this project is to determine the minimum set of rules that together conjugate all verbs in the French Language.
It uses the french-verbs-lefff project as the database for the conjugations of over 7000 verbs. 

The project is implemented with TDD as follows: 

- Select a verb and its conjugations from the database
- Conjugate using the library
- If it fails, add the rule or rules that make it pass
